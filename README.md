## Description

This app uses a MongoDB database to track your workouts, log your exercises, and show you your fitness stats.

Here's a User Story for the App:
As a user,
I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts.
I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.
I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.
If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
